# Metco Assignment

## Objective 
 - To forecast energy consumption by learning historical data and little other building information.
 
## Approach
 - Created new features based on the timestamp and building metadata
 - Used ‘Training’ data to train a Random Forest Regression Model
 - Used ‘Test’ data to validate the model’s performance
 - Finally predicted the energy consumption for ‘Predictions’ data

## Stats
 - There are total 1383 buildings for which metadata is available in ‘building’ dataframe
 - Training Data consists of 758 buildings
 - Test Data consists of 625 buildings
